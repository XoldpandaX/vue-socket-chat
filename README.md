## What all this about ?
It is a simple chat realization created with vue.js + vue-native-websocket
It is a demo for now, so i highly recommend to watch this example only in
last versions of google-chrome only in desktop mode, because in this project no
adaptivity and responsivity for 100%

There is exist problems with cyrillic font in "Press Start 2P" -font, so russian letters
displaying incorrectly, type in english please ^_^
